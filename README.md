## 7️⃣ Design Goals

```md
## Design Goals

- Minimal visual noise
- Keyboard dominance
- Instant feedback
- Native-feeling motion
- Easy to integrate and customize

GlyphX is intended as a foundational UI primitive, not a full application.

## Status

GlyphX is in early development.  
APIs may change until a stable release is published.
